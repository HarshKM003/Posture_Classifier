# Posture_Classifier

Our project is based on Computer vision application where we can able to
detect the right posture for yoga ananas. Here we use the deep learning and transfer learning
concept along with open CV library package to estimate the right posture for yoga
asana. We used a pretrained VGG16 model to train our dataset where we try to detect the posture and enhance
the accuracy of estimating the correct posture of the yoga.
